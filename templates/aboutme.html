        <div id="about">

            <p class="text-center lead mt-2 mb-4">As a computer science student at Tecnologico de Monterrey, I find joy in a variety of activities. Aside from coding and learning new programming languages, I also enjoy staying active through exercise. Whether it's going for a run or hitting the gym, I find that physical activity helps me stay focused and energized throughout the day.</p>
            <p class="text-center lead mt-2 mb-4">In addition to staying active, I also enjoy solving problems on platforms like LeetCode. I find these challenges to be both fun and rewarding, as they allow me to apply my coding skills in a practical way. I believe that problem-solving is an essential skill for any computer science student, and I enjoy taking on new challenges whenever I can.</p>
            <p class="text-center lead mt-2 mb-4">Finally, I believe that being a good teammate is crucial for success in any field. That's why I always strive to add value to any team that I'm a part of. Whether it's through my technical skills, my ability to communicate effectively, or my willingness to help others, I believe that being a good teammate is essential for achieving our collective goals.</p>
            <p class="text-center lead mt-2 mb-4">Overall, I'm excited to continue my journey as a computer science student, and I look forward to exploring new opportunities for growth and learning in the years ahead.</p>
